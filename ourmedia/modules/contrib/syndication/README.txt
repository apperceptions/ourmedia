Readme

Syndication.module offers a web page which centralizes all of the RSS feeds
generated by Drupal. This helps users find interesting feeds from your web site.

Currently, the syndication page helps visitors find the following feeds:
- the blog feed of any user or all users
- node feeds for any taxonomy terms, including composites of terms (requires taxonomy_dhtml.module)
- a directory of all feeds being consumed by the import.module

Also, modules may insert their own boxes onto this page using the 'syndication' hook. See Help for details

Feel free to improve this module and upload your improvements to Contrib.

Requirements
------------

To display taxonomy feeds, install the taxonomy_dhtml.module.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the syndication.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Admin -> Site Configuration -> Modules

2. Browse to Admin -> Blocks and enable the Syndication (more) block. You'll also want
to disable the plain Syndication block offerred by node.module.

3. optional. the taxononomy_dhtml.module exports a block onto this page.

To see your new Syndication page, follow the 'more' link which appears in the Block.
