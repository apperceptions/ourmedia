Installation of quotes.module could not be simpler. Simply copy the
entire quotes module directory to your Drupal modules directory. Then
log into your site, enable the quotes module on the admin/modules
page, and go to the admin/quotes page to install and configure the
module.

If you are upgrading from a pre-4.5 version, you will be prompted to
upgrade and guided through an import of your existing quotes. (Note
that 1000 quotes will be imported at a time.) The module will not be
fully functional until the upgrade/import is complete. To display
random quote blocks, you will need to create and configure them on the
admin/quotes/blocks page and enable them in the block configuration
(admin/block).

The quotes module has three permissions:

* administer quotes:
    allows users to administer the quotes module and
    create/configure/delete random quote blocks
* edit own quotes:
    allows users to maintain a personal list of quotations
* promote quotes to block:
    allows users to promote their quotes so that they will appear in
    any defined random quote blocks

NOTE: Use of Drupal's cache (in "site configuration") is discouraged
as a static quote will be cached, and anonymous users will not see a
random quote.  It will only be updated when a logged-in user makes a
change that invalidates the cache.  If you have any ideas on getting
around this limitation, please let me know.
