REQUIREMENTS
------------

The copyright module requires a standard Drupal installation (drupal.org).

OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
-------------------

- To use book-level copyright management the book module must be enabled
  on your Drupal site.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD MODULE

   You can obtain the latest release from http://drupal.org/.
   Download and extract the files (replace x.x.x with version number):

     $ wget http://drupal.org/project/copyright/copyright-x.x.x.tar.gz
     $ tar -zxvf copyright-x.x.x.tar.gz

   This will create a new directory copyright-x.x.x.  cd into this
   directory.

2. UPDATE THE DRUPAL DATABASE

   These instructions are for MySQL. Execute the script as a user who's
   permitted to create tables in your Drupal database (usually the user
   account used to run Drupal).  Example:

     $ mysql -u [uid] [drupal_database] < copyright.mysql

4. INSTALL MODULE

     $ cp copyright.module /[drupalpath]/modules

5. CONFIGURE MODULE

   Log into your Drupal site.  Go to the administer/modules page and
   select the copyright module as enabled.  Save the configuration.
   
   Go to the administer/copyright page.  Set site-wide settings
   and edit/create copyrights/licenses as desired.
   
   Optionally go to the administer/blocks page and enable the copyright
   block.  It's suggested to either enable the block or turn on the footer
   message, but not both.  Only one copyright notice should be displayed.

CUSTOMIZING YOUR THEME(S) - OPTIONAL
------------------------------------

The copyright module adds two new theme hooks:
- theme_copyright_footer - displayed as node and/or site footer
- theme_copyright_block - for the inner text of the copyright block

Use of these hooks is not required.  If you don't modify your theme 
to have these hooks a default layout will be used for copyright notices.
These hook functions can be customized within themes in the standard way.
Create themename_copyright_footer and/or themename_copyright_block and they
will be used automatically.  Example, for the goofy.theme file you might
want to add:

function goofy_copyright_footer($notice)
{
  return '<div style="margin:4pt;font-size:smaller;font-weight:lighter">' . $notice . '</div>';
}
function goofy_copyright_block($notice)
{
  return '<div style="text-align:center">' . $notice . '</div>';
}

For theme engines check their documentation on how to use these "custom"
hooks.

UPGRADING
---------

Simply overwrite the existing modules/copyright.module with the new one.
No database changes have been made.
