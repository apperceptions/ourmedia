WARNING:
--------
In order to properly install and configure the banner module, you might need
some knowledge of PHP, the Drupal themeing system, and of using tools such as
patch.  This module can be difficult to install.

The following document attempts to make the installation process more clear.
Please follow these steps carefully and exactly as written before filing a
support request.  It is advised that you review this entire document before
you try and install this module.


-----------
Preparation:
-----------

0) Properly configure 'File system' support for your Drupal installation.
    (Goto :: administer -> settings :: then find "File system settings")
   Follow the directions on this page to set a proper "File system path"
   and "Temporary directory".  When this is properly configured, you will
   not see any errors.


------------
Installation:
------------

1) The first thing to do is to update your database, adding the 'banner' table.
   This can easily be done from the command line by copying the included 
   'banner.mysql' file to your webserver, then running a command something
   like:
      $ mysql -u<username> -p<password> <database> < banner.mysql

   For example, if your username is 'drupal', your password is 'secret', and
   your database is called 'drupal', you'd type the following command:
      $ mysql -udrupal -psecret drupal < banner.mysql

2) Move 'banner.module' into your modules/ directory.

3) Move 'banner_db.php' and 'banner_file.php' into your top level Drupal 
   directory.  Give these files proper permissions so that they can be
   read by the webserver.

   (These files are added for performance reasons.  By utilizing these files
    the banner.module can display different banners to different people even
    on cached pages.  The actual performance gain is realized by not including
    Drupal's include files each time a banner needs to be displayed...)

4) Now you need to log in to your site and enable the new banner.module.
    (Goto :: administer -> modules :: then check 'banner')


-------------
Configuration:
-------------

5) Configure the banner module.  At minimum, it is _HIGHLY_ recommended that
   you enable the file caching mechanism built into this module.  The rest
   of the settings can be left at their defaults for now.
    (Goto :: administer -> settings -> banner)
   (The file-caching mechanism used by this module greatly increases 
    banner-display performance.  It is not required, but you will not
    get very good performance from this module without it.)

6) Setup banner module permissions.
    (Goto :: administer -> users -> configure -> permissions)
   - Give 'show banners' permission to users that should see the banners.
   - Give 'manage banners' permission to users that should be allowed to
     upload and track view/click statistics for their own banners.
   - Give 'administer banners' permission to users that should be allowed to
     add/edit/delete all banners on your site.


---------------------------
Uploading graphical banners:
---------------------------

7) Upload a new banner via the administrative interface.
    (Goto :: administer -> banners -> add)
   - give the banner a descriptive title.  (when you are managing lots of
     banners, it becomes important that this title describe the banner)
   - enter a URL where you want clicking on the banner to take you.
   - set the status to 'enabled' so that the banner is displayed.
   - scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'browse' to select a banner
     image to upload.  (it is important that the filename of your image
     end in three characters indicating the filetype.  Supported image types
     are:  jpg, jpeg, gif, png, bmp and tiff)
   - click save.  For now, we'll leave the rest of the options set to their
     defaults.  Once everything is confirmed to be working on your
     installation, then you can worry about the more complicated configuration
     options.

8) Preview the newly uploaded banner.
    (Goto :: administer -> banners)
   You should currently see a list of all the banners you've uploaded.  Find
   the name of the banner you just uploaded, and click 'view' in the options
   column.  You should now see your banner at the top of the page, along with
   general information and statistics about the banner.  If you don't see
   the banner you just uploaded, something has gone wrong.  If you're seeing
   garbage text instead of the image, then the module failed to recoginze
   the file type and is instead trying to display the image as text.  Be sure
   the file name is something like "banner.jpg" or "banner.png", specifically
   including the three letters at the end appropriate to the file type.

-----------------------------
Uploading text advertisements:
-----------------------------

9) Prepare the text ad.
   Text ads require a little extra manual effort.  Specifically, you must
   add a link within the the text of the ad that points to the banner's
   appropriate link url.  After the banner is created, you can find the 
   banner's id at "administer -> banners".  (Yes, this means you will need
   to upload the banner twice.  The first time you upload the banner you
   won't know the new banners id.)

   Assuming the banner has an id of 13, you will need to include a link in
   the banner's text to the URL "/banner/13".  For example:
      <a href="http://mysite.com/banner/13">banner text</a>

   Note: Do NOT link directly to where the banner is actually taking you, or
   the clicks will NOT be counted.  When uploading the banner, you will be
   able to set the end URL.

10) Upload a new banner via the administrative interface.
     (Goto :: administer -> banners -> add)
    - give the banner a descriptive title.  (when you are managing lots of
      banners, it becomes important that this title describe the banner)
    - enter a URL where you want clicking on the text ad to take you.
    - set the status to 'enabled' so that the text ad is displayed.
    - scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'browse' to select the
      text file to upload.  (it is advised that the filename of your text
      ad end in with '.txt'.  If you do not do this, the banner module may
      not recognize your ad as being text and it may not display properly.)
    - click save.  For now, we'll leave the rest of the options set to their
      defaults.  Once everything is confirmed to be working on your
      installation, then you can worry about the more complicated configuration
      options.

11) Preview the newly uploaded text ad.
     (Goto :: administer -> banners)
    You should currently see a list of all the ads you've uploaded.  Find
    the name of the text ad you just uploaded, and click 'view' in the options
    column.  You should now see your text ad at the top of the page, along with
    general information and statistics about the ad.  If you don't see
    the text from the ad you just uploaded, something has gone wrong.  Try
    renaming the text file to end with '.txt' and uploading it again.

You can see an example of text ads in action at http://kerneltrap.org/


-------------------------------------------
Displaying banners and text ads from blocks:
-------------------------------------------

12) The easiest way to display banners and text ads on your site (easiest
    because then you do not have to edit your theme) is to display them from
    a Drupal block.
     (Goto :: administer -> blocks -> add)
    - set a title for the block, such as 'Advertisement'
    - set the input format to 'PHP code'
    - In the block body, enter the following:
       <?php return banner_display(); ?>
    - optionally enter a block description
    - click 'Save block'
    - at "administer -> blocks' enable your new block


-----------------------------------
Displaying multiple ads on one page:
-----------------------------------

13) The banner module currently supports up to ten different unique groups
    of banners.  The default display group is 0.  You can also display banners
    from groups 1 thorugh 9.  This allows you to for example display banner
    ads at the top of your page, and text ads in a block on the side.
    The display group of a given ad is set when you add the banner, or later
    by editing it.  To display banners in a different group, you need to pass
    in the group number when calling banner_display.  For example, to display
    banners from group 3 you would use the following call:
       <?php return banner_display(3); ?>


-----------------------------------------------
Displaying banners and text ads from your theme:
-----------------------------------------------

14) To display a banner from your theme, you will need to modify the theme.
    How this is done is different for each theme.  Essentially though, you
    need to add a call to banner_display() in the appropriate place. 
    (Finding the appropriate place is the challenge.)

    For some simple examples, refer to the sample patches that come with
    the banner.module.  (The sample patches are in contributed/theme)

    Sorry, I am unable to provide sample patches for all available themes.
    Please refer to the provided sample patches to better understand how you
    can patch your favorite themes yourself.

FAQ
---
Q. I don't see any images.  What's wrong?
A. Be sure you installed 'banner_db_php' and 'banner_file.php', and
   properly set the permissions on these files so they can be read
   by your webserver.   (See step 3 above)

Q. I did install the files correctly, but I still don't see any images.
   What's wrong?
A. Try refreshing the banner cache.  Go to:
      administer >> banner >> refresh cache

Q. I've refreshed my cache, but I'm still not seeing images.  What's wrong?
A. Edit the banner and be sure that the MIME type was properly detected.  Go
   to:
      administer >> banner >> list
   then click 'edit' next to problematic banner.  At the bottom of the page
   you can update the MIME type.
