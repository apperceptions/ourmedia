o weather module v 1.73
o added weather cron functionality
o added re-caching for anonymous pages
  - the weather block in previously cached pages
    gets updated whenever the logged in user pages
    get updated.
NOTES: both of these features can be used together to keep
       the weather block up-to-date; however, on sites
       with several [cached] pages, the re-caching feature
       can cause significant overhead during the update
       process, which happens once every hour.
